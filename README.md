blazing souls is a project created by @Byrrrd aka solarflare0421. the idea of the platform is for people to have a DeviantArt alternative that has annual art tournaments. it is inspired by
DeviantArt as well as a project called tales.archangelgca.eu, a project created by @ArchangelGCA. while it is still under development, it will be released to the public soon.
